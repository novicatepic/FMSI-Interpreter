# FMSI-Interpreter

Implement an interpreter for arithmetic expressions that supports proper execution of operations on integers. The required functionalities are:

-Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and integer division

-Printing the value of expressions and variable values using the print command with an expression or variable name as an argument

-Correct interpretation of negative numbers in expressions

-Grouping of arithmetic expressions using parentheses

-Assignment of values to variables and using variables within expressions

Additionally, the construction of a parsing tree should be possible (for debugging purposes). Ensure proper coverage of functionalities with unit tests. You are allowed to use only the standard library. The use of lexer and parser generators is not permitted.
